                <h2>LAMPARD</h2>
                <p> Lampard:I want to play <strong>Free Flowing Football</strong></p>
                <h3>The Managers Take</h3>
                <p>Our caretaker manager believes it is far more complicated for a manager than just selecting a side that will play front-foot, attacking football that is both effective and attractive on the eye. He admits that is of course the end goal but there are other areas of the game which are equally important.
                    ‘Coming in here, I think the systems have changed a lot and that hasn’t brought an answer,' explained Lampard. 'I don’t think there is one answer or the other.<em>'For Real Madrid I got criticised going into the game for being too defensive but for me, that was the only way to approach that game.</em> After 60 minutes, we could have been 1-0 or 2-0 up and then that game and the whole tie looks different.’

                <h2>The Columnist</h2>
                <p> Pat Nevin: Old cliches are true, the most important game is <strong>the next one</strong>
                </p>              
                <h3>Chelsea Academy</h3>
                <p> The old saying in football, <strong>that you are only as good as your last game, could also be considered in another tense; you are only as good as your next game.</strong> That is why that other hoary old cliche, ‘we will take every game as it comes’, never becomes dated. The next game for Chelsea is against Arsenal tonight and at the Emirates it is obviously going to be one of the hardest of the season. The Gunners have run a superb league race, even if many feel they are just running out of breath as they enter the home straight. That may be true, or it might not be, time will tell, but there is no doubt tonight’s atmosphere will be incredible as the home fans do everything to lift their favourites for that final sprint finish.</p>

                <h2>Chelsea Fans</h2>
                <p>Arsenal know they must win every game between now and the end of the season 
                            in the league if they are going to be ready to take advantage of any 
                            slip from Manchester City. That brings its own pressure and we will 
                            discover how good they are at coping with that sort of stress 
                            tonight.
                </p>
                <h3>Spoil the Party like its 2016</h3>
                <p>Few Chelsea fans will be able to think about this game without 
                            considering what was in many ways a very similar situation a few 
                            years back, in 2016, when Arsenal’s north London neighbours came down 
                            to the Bridge with their sights on the title. Spurs had to overcome 
                            us if they were going to have any chance of stealing the title from 
                            shock leaders Leicester City. That wasn’t our best season, in fact the 
                            10th-place finish was the lowest in the last quarter of a century.
                            Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard scored in the second half, 
                            Spurs imploded and that match at Stamford Bridge has gone down in 
                            Chelsea folklore as the night we scuppered their only chance to win 
                            the Premier League. Far be it from me to take any pleasure from that, 
                            but I am assured that some Chelsea fans still do!
